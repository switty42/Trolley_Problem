Docs 08-26-25 V1 (For questions or comments:  Stephen Witty switty@level500.com)  

### Project Overview:
This project adapts the classic Trolley Problem example into a modern version of the problem. The new problem involves an electric car driven by an AI. The AI finds itself in an unavoidable accident and must pick between individuals or groups to impact.  Data is collected to study the choices the AI makes. The AI model is an uncensored version on Venice.ai. The AI prompts used are contained in this repository along with a presentation that covers the results.  The source code that interacts with the AI model is also included.
